Pizza Sales Data Analysis with MySQL Workbench Welcome to the Pizza Sales Data Analysis project repository! In this project, we leverage the power of MySQL Workbench and SQL queries to analyze pizza sales data and extract valuable insights.

Overview The goal of this project is to explore and understand the sales patterns, customer preferences, and operational trends within our pizza sales data. By utilizing MySQL Workbench, a robust database management tool, we can efficiently query, manipulate, and visualize our data to uncover actionable insights that drive business decisions.

Dataset The dataset included in this repository contains transactional data from our pizza sales, including information such as order date,order_id, customer ID, pizza type, quantity, and sales revenue,etc. This dataset serves as the foundation for our analysis, allowing us to gain insights into customer behavior, popular pizza choices, peak sales periods, and more.

Analysis Approach We utilize a variety of SQL queries within MySQL Workbench to perform our analysis. These queries include aggregations, joins, subqueries, and more, enabling us to answer key business questions and uncover hidden patterns within the data. Our analysis approach is structured yet flexible, allowing us to adapt to the evolving needs of our analysis as we explore the dataset.

By working with four datasets and addressing 13 key business questions, I explored various insights, including:

• How sales patterns evolved over time

• Which pizzas customers preferred the most

• Opportunities for improving business performance

This project was an excellent opportunity to enhance my SQL skills and demonstrate how data can guide strategic business decisions. If you’re interested in the details, feel free to check out the full analysis in the attached report.

Conclusion Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the power of MySQL Workbench and SQL queries in extracting actionable insights from raw data. By leveraging these tools effectively, we can uncover valuable insights that drive informed business decisions and ultimately contribute to the success of our pizza sales operation.

Thank you for exploring our Pizza Sales Data Analysis project! Happy analyzing!
